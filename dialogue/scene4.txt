Wang Yun:Fengxian, Dong Zhuo has already taken Diaochan by force tonight. If we delay, the Han Dynasty will fall!
Lu Bu:That old beast... must die!
Wang Yun:(Presenting weapon)The Seven-Star Dagger. At noon tomorrow, the 'sobering soup' will leave him helpless.
Lu Bu:And if we fail?
Wang Yun:(cold smile)Then let the peonies of Phoenix Pavilion... bloom with blood.
Lu Bu:Slave of Three Names?... Tonight, I claim one titleâ€”'Dong Zhuo's Executioner'!
