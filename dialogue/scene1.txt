Wang Yun: General Fengxian, what brings you to my humble abode today?
Lu Bu: You flatter me, Minister. I came specifically to pay my respects.
Diaochan: This humble maiden Diao Chan pays her respects to the general.
Lu Bu: (gazing at Diao Chan) My lady's beauty puts flowers to shame. I've never seen such grace...
Diaochan: (lowering her head) You praise me too highly, general. I'm but an ordinary woman...
Wang Yun: (smiling) My daughter Diao Chan has trained in song and dance since childhood. 
Wang Yun: Perhaps she could perform for you?
